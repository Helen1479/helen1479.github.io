        function, it can use for simply a powerful computer that stores and transmits data via the internet.</p>
         

        <p>2. Explain why getting a domain name is not enough to put your site up on the web.</p>
        <p>Because it doesn't have the local document with your site up on the web, you will not scan the same web with what you created.</p>
        
        <p>3. What service does a website hosting company provide?</p>

        <p>4. What are the most important characteristics to look for in selecting a good web hosting company?</p>
        <p>The Backup Services, Guaranteed Uptime and Adequate Scalability are the important characteristics for keeping the website running on. </p>
          
        <p>5. Research companies that provide website hosting plans. On average, what is the price range (price per month) for hosting a website?</p>

        <p>6. What are the most important features for you when reviewing a hosting plan? </p>

    <h2>Basic HTML Table</h2>

<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <th>bluehost</th>
    <th>hostgator</th> 
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Domain-name registration costs</td>
    <td>free</td>
    <td>free</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Database Support</td>
    <td>mySQL</td>
    <td>SQL server</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Website-Traffic Limitations</td>
    <td>Unlimited</td>
    <td>Unlimited</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Server Storage Space</td>
    <td>50GB</td>
    <td>Unlimited</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Costs per month</td>
    <td>$2.95</td>
    <td>$2.75</td>
  </tr>

  <p>In this case, I think the company hostgator and its hosting plans as the best value for the price.</p>
